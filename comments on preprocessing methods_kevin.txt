Stemming:
Stemming converts words to their word stem. For example, 'raining' is converted to 'rain'. It is useful for dealing with sparsity issues as well as standardizing vocabulary. 
However, there is criticism on stemming as some words can be incorrectly processed. An example is that 'Ring' can be converted to 'R' which is obviously wrong.
The library considered in our code is 'PorterStemmer' from 'nltk.stem'. 
Based on positve/negative impact on our model accuracy, we decided to exclude/include the stemming process.


Lemmatizing:
Lemmatizing is considered as an advanced version of stemming, and ofter produces higher accuracy.
It looks up each word in a dictionary and maps it to its proper base form.
The risk of incorrectly converting a word is lower compared to stemming. 
Although stemming can be faster to run, lemmatizing is prerred in our case for better performance.
